## 767. Reorganize String

Key idea: Suppose `a` is the most frequently appearing letter in `S`. Then `S` is reorganizable iff `a` is reorganizable.

```python
import collections

length = len(S)
counts = collections.Counter(S)
maxCount = max(counts.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])[1]
```

We know if `maxCount > (length+1) / 2`, `S` is not reorganizable.

Otherwise, we can reorganize `S`

```python
reorganize = [''] * length
evenIndex, oddIndex = 0,1

for a, count in counts.items():
    while count>0 and evenIndex < length:
        count -= 1
        reorganize[evenIndex] = a
        evenIndex += 2
    while count>0:
        count -= 1
        reorganize[oddIndex] = a
        oddIndex += 2

```

But there is a bug! You may got `babaa`.

Final pass code:

```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, S: str) -> str:
        
        length = len(S)
        counts = collections.Counter(S)
        maxCount = max(counts.items(), key=lambda x:x[1])[1]

        if maxCount>(length+1)//2:
            return ""
        
        reorganize = [''] * length
        evenIndex, oddIndex = 0,1

        for a, count in counts.items():
            while count>0 and count<=length//2 
                    and oddIndex < length:
                count -= 1
                reorganize[oddIndex] = a
                oddIndex += 2
            while count>0 and evenIndex < length:
                count -= 1
                reorganize[evenIndex] = a
                evenIndex += 2
            
        
        return "".join(reorganize)
```
